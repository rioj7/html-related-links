# HTML Related Links

Add a View of related and linked files of an HTML file to the Explorer container.

![HTML Related Links View](images/html-related-links.png)

The files will be sorted based on there full path.

If you click on an entry in the view that file will be opened. If the file does not exist nothing happens.

The tags handled are: `a`, `img`, `link`, `script`.

## TODO
* handle absolute paths (what is the root of the website?)
* handle multi root workspace
* add the possibility to create a file that does not exist
